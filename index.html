			<h2>What is Quantum Mechanics?</h2>
			<p>Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. It is a fundamental theory that has revolutionized our understanding of the physical world and has led to the development of technologies such as transistors, lasers, and nuclear power.</p>

		<section id="history-of-quantum-mechanics">
			<h2>History of Quantum Mechanics</h2>
			<p>Quantum mechanics was developed in the early 20th century by physicists such as Max Planck, Albert Einstein, and Niels Bohr. It was initially developed to explain the behavior of atoms and molecules, but it has since been applied to many other areas of physics.</p>

			<h2>Fundamental Principles</h2>
			<p>Quantum mechanics is based on several fundamental principles, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Wave-particle duality</li>
				<li>Quantization</li>
				<li>Superposition</li>
				<li>Uncertainty principle</li>
			</ul>

		<section id="quantum-entanglement">
			<h2>Quantum Entanglement</h2>
			<p>Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two or more particles can be connected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other particle, even if they are separated by a large distance. It is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and has applications in quantum computing and cryptography.</p>
